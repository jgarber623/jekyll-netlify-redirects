## Getting Started

Before installing and using jekyll-netlify-redirects, you'll want to familiarize yourself with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (a fabulous static site generator written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (a fabulous website hosting service). In particular, you'll want to read up on Netlify's [Redirect & Rewrite Rules documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/).

## Installation

If you're using [Bundler](https://bundler.io), add jekyll-netlify-redirects to your project's `Gemfile`:

```rb
source 'https://rubygems.org'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-netlify-redirects'
end
```

‚Ä¶and hop over to your command prompt and run‚Ä¶

```sh
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

With jekyll-netlify-redirects added to your project's `Gemfile` and installed, add the following to your [Jekyll configuration file](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) (typically `_config.yml`):

```yaml
netlify:
  redirects:
    - /home              /
    - /blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
    - /news              /blog
    - /google            https://www.google.com
```

**Note:** Netlify supports a variety of redirection and rewrite rules, so comb through their [Redirect & Rewrite Rules documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/) for more on the syntax. You may also want to test your redirect and rewrite rules at [Netlify's Playground](https://play.netlify.com/redirects).

With this configuration added to `_config.yml` (or to your custom Jekyll configuration file), Jekyll will generate a properly-formatted `_redirects` file in the destination directory when building your project.
